## Features

### üîç Search Tools

- **Tavily Search**: Optimized for factual information with strong
  citation support. Supports domain filtering through API parameters
  (include_domains/exclude_domains).
- **Brave Search**: Privacy-focused search with good technical content
  coverage. Features native support for search operators (site:,
  -site:, filetype:, intitle:, inurl:, before:, after:, and exact
  phrases).
- **Kagi Search**: High-quality search results with minimal
  advertising influence, focused on authoritative sources. Supports
  search operators in query string (site:, -site:, filetype:,
  intitle:, inurl:, before:, after:, and exact phrases).
- **Exa Search**: AI-powered semantic web search using neural
  embeddings. Unlike keyword-based search, Exa understands meaning and
  context to find the most relevant content. Best for research,
  factual queries, and discovering content that matches semantic intent
  rather than exact keywords. Supports domain filtering through API
  parameters (includeDomains/excludeDomains).
- **Bright Data SERP API**: Comprehensive search engine data collection
  with proxy management and unblocking. Supports Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo,
  Yandex, Baidu, Yahoo, and Naver. Best for large-scale data collection,
  market research, brand monitoring, and applications requiring robust
  anti-blocking capabilities. Features native support for search operators.

### üéØ Search Operators

MCP Omnisearch provides powerful search capabilities through operators
and parameters:

#### Common Search Features

- Domain filtering: Available across all providers
  - Tavily: Through API parameters (include_domains/exclude_domains)
  - Brave & Kagi: Through site: and -site: operators
- File type filtering: Available in Brave and Kagi (filetype:)
- Title and URL filtering: Available in Brave and Kagi (intitle:,
  inurl:)
- Date filtering: Available in Brave and Kagi (before:, after:)

### ü§ñ AI Response Tools

- **Perplexity AI**: Advanced response generation combining real-time
  web search with GPT-4 Omni and Claude 3
- **Kagi FastGPT**: Quick AI-generated answers with citations (900ms
  typical response time)

### üìÑ Content Processing Tools

- **Jina AI Reader**: Clean content extraction with image captioning
  and PDF support
- **Kagi Universal Summarizer**: Content summarization for pages,
  videos, and podcasts

  pages with configurable extraction depth ('basic' or 'advanced').
  Returns both combined content and individual URL content, with
  metadata including word count and extraction statistics
- **Firecrawl Scrape**: Extract clean, LLM-ready data from single URLs
  with enhanced formatting options
- **Firecrawl Crawl**: Deep crawling of all accessible subpages on a
  website with configurable depth limits

  indexes (Teclis, TinyGem)
- **Jina AI Grounding**: Real-time fact verification against web
  knowledge

## Flexible API Key Requirements

MCP Omnisearch is designed to work with the API keys you have
available. You don't need to have keys for all providers - the server
will automatically detect which API keys are available and only enable
those providers.

For example:

- If you only have a Tavily and Perplexity API key, only those
  providers will be available
- If you don't have a Kagi API key, Kagi-based services won't be
  available, but all other providers will work normally
- The server will log which providers are available based on the API
  keys you've configured

This flexibility makes it easy to get started with just one or two
providers and add more as needed.

## Configuration

This server requires configuration through your MCP client. Here are
examples for different environments:

### Cline Configuration

Add this to your Cline MCP settings:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "node",
			"args": ["/path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"],
			"env": {
				"TAVILY_API_KEY": "your-tavily-key",
				"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "your-perplexity-key",
				"KAGI_API_KEY": "your-kagi-key",
				"JINA_AI_API_KEY": "your-jina-key",
				"BRAVE_API_KEY": "your-brave-key",
				"EXA_API_KEY": "your-exa-key",
				"BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY": "your-brightdata-key",
				"BRIGHTDATA_ZONE_NAME": "your-zone-name",
				"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY": "your-firecrawl-key",
				"FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL": "http://localhost:3002"
			},
			"disabled": false,
			"autoApprove": []
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop with WSL Configuration

For WSL environments, add this to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"mcp-omnisearch": {
			"command": "wsl.exe",
			"args": [
				"bash",
				"-c",
				"TAVILY_API_KEY=key1 PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=key2 KAGI_API_KEY=key3 JINA_AI_API_KEY=key4 BRAVE_API_KEY=key5 EXA_API_KEY=key6 BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY=key7 BRIGHTDATA_ZONE_NAME=zone1 FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=key8 FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002 node /path/to/mcp-omnisearch/dist/index.js"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

### Environment Variables

The server uses API keys for each provider. **You don't need keys for
all providers** - only the providers corresponding to your available
API keys will be activated:

- `TAVILY_API_KEY`: For Tavily Search
- `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`: For Perplexity AI
- `KAGI_API_KEY`: For Kagi services (FastGPT, Summarizer, Enrichment)
- `JINA_AI_API_KEY`: For Jina AI services (Reader, Grounding)
- `BRAVE_API_KEY`: For Brave Search
- `EXA_API_KEY`: For Exa Search
- `BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY`: For Bright Data SERP API
- `BRIGHTDATA_ZONE_NAME`: For Bright Data zone configuration (optional, defaults to 'serp_api')
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`: For Firecrawl services (Scrape, Crawl, Map,
  Extract, Actions)
- `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL`: For self-hosted Firecrawl instances (optional,
  defaults to Firecrawl cloud service)

You can start with just one or two API keys and add more later as
needed. The server will log which providers are available on startup.

### Self-Hosted Firecrawl Configuration

If you're running a self-hosted instance of Firecrawl, you can
configure MCP Omnisearch to use it by setting the `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL`
environment variable. This allows you to maintain complete control
over your data processing pipeline.

**Self-hosted Firecrawl setup:**

1. Follow the
   [Firecrawl self-hosting guide](https://docs.firecrawl.dev/contributing/self-host)
2. Set up your Firecrawl instance (default runs on
   `http://localhost:3002`)
3. Configure MCP Omnisearch with your self-hosted URL:

```bash
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3002
# or for a remote self-hosted instance:
FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL=https://your-firecrawl-domain.com
```

**Important notes:**

- If `FIRECRAWL_BASE_URL` is not set, MCP Omnisearch will default to
  the Firecrawl cloud service
- Self-hosted instances support the same API endpoints (`/v1/scrape`,
  `/v1/crawl`, etc.)
- You'll still need a `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` even for self-hosted
  instances
- Self-hosted Firecrawl provides enhanced security and customization
  options

## Docker Deployment

MCP Omnisearch supports containerized deployment using Docker with
MCPO (Model Context Protocol Over HTTP) integration, enabling cloud
deployment and OpenAPI access.

### Quick Start with Docker

1. **Using Docker Compose (Recommended)**:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/spences10/mcp-omnisearch.git
cd mcp-omnisearch

# Create .env file with your API keys
echo "TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key" > .env
echo "KAGI_API_KEY=your-kagi-key" >> .env
echo "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key" >> .env
# Add other API keys as needed

# Start the container
docker-compose up -d
```

2. **Using Docker directly**:

```bash
docker build -t mcp-omnisearch .
docker run -d \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TAVILY_API_KEY=your-tavily-key \
  -e KAGI_API_KEY=your-kagi-key \
  -e PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-key \
  --name mcp-omnisearch \
  mcp-omnisearch
```

### Container Environment Variables

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

4. Run in development mode:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Publishing

1. Update version in package.json
2. Build the project:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

3. Publish to npm:

```bash
pnpm publish
```

## Troubleshooting

### API Keys and Access

Each provider requires its own API key and may have different access
requirements:

- **Tavily**: Requires an API key from their developer portal
- **Perplexity**: API access through their developer program
- **Kagi**: Some features limited to Business (Team) plan users
- **Jina AI**: API key required for all services
- **Brave**: API key from their developer portal
- **Exa**: API key required from their developer portal
- **Bright Data**: API key and zone configuration required from their platform
- **Firecrawl**: API key required from their developer portal

### Rate Limits

Each provider has its own rate limits. The server will handle rate
limit errors gracefully and return appropriate error messages.
